This is an easy to use SensorThings API Client written in Python

The SensorThings API (STA) is an [OGC](https://www.osgeo.org/partners/ogc/) standard for IoT device sensing data.\
A server implementation of the STA can be found here [FROST](https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/FROST-Server)

## Installation

`stapy` is compatible with Python 3.6+ and the recommended way to install is via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
```bash
pip install stapy
```

## Usage

`stapy` can be used both form the command line (in two different ways) and as a Python library.

### API_URL

At first it is necessary to set the URL of the STA.
Within the CLI this can be achieved as follows:
```bash
python -m stapy -u {URL}
```
The URL can also be set from within a Python script:
```python
>>> import stapy

>>> stapy.set_api_url({URL})
```

### CLI - Interactive

The interactive mode is the easiest one to use but can **not** be used programmatically.
Therefore it is probably a good starting point to get familiar with the STA.
The interactive mode can be invoked in the following way.
```bash
python -m stapy -i
```
Currently it does support `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests.

### CLI - Normal

The *normal* command line mode is a bit more difficult to use but can be automated.
```bash
python -m stapy --help
```
Should give sufficient information on how two use it properly.
As the interactive mode it does support `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests.

### Library

This is the Python interface to the SensorThings API (stapy is meant to be used as Python library).
Therefore it supports all relevant requests (`POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` and `GET`).

The relevant classes can be found within the files `entity.py`, `delete.py`, `post.py`, `patch.py` and `query.py` in the [sta](https://github.com/zMoooooritz/stapy/tree/master/stapy/sta) sub-module.

The following syntax can be used to create new entities:
```python
>>> from stapy import Post

>>> Post.observed_property("TestProp", "TestProp-Desc", "TestProp-Def")
```
To understand which arguments are available and mandatory it is advisable to have a look at the [STA-Docs](https://developers.sensorup.com/docs/) and/or use the interactive mode stapy.

Following is one example for a `GET` request:
```python
>>> from stapy import Query, Entity

>>> results, times = Query(Entity.Observation).select("result", "phenomenonTIme").order("result").get_data_sets()
```
`results` afterwards contains **all** results of the present Observations in ascending order.\
`times` contains the respective times for the results.

stapy does support all `GET` query options that are available for the [STA](https://developers.sensorup.com/docs/#queryparameters).
Some examples are select, filter, orderby and skip. These can be chained together as seen in the example above.

## Development
To build this project, run `python setup.py build`. To execute the unit tests, run `python setup.py test`
